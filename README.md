## Overview 
W. Avy requested I pull data on the temperatures for the months of June and December to best estimate business seasons for the soon to be opened surf and ice cream shop. This was done by finding the temperatures for the months of June and December over approximately a seven-year span for each. 

## Results 
The findings for the temperatures for June and December are listed below. All findings are in degrees Fahrenheit.

The results show that each month has very comparable weather with the highs being 85 and 83 for June and December respectively. They also have comparable lows and averages. June’s come in at 64 and 74.9 while December’s are 56 and 71. 

## Summary
When looking into the temperature data a little further, the seemingly best indicator that both months will work is while comparing the 2nd and 3rd quartiles of each. June’s are 75 and 77 degrees while December’s are 71 and 74 degrees. Since this range is closer to where the weather will most commonly stay, it would be best to use it as the leading decider for when to operate. 
Another strong indicator is to look at the standard deviations of the two months. With June at 3.25 and December at 3.74. With only approximately a 0.5 difference, there is little concern of drastically changing weather between the two months. 

It should be safe to expect little to no interruption to business and customer volume due to temperature between the two months.
